# TODO NuxtJS

With the evolution of internet and it's various tools, very often, I see myself learning much easier with a hands on approach, increasing the difficulty by chunks of functionality and complexity.

Dispite of the simplicity of a todo-app, it is a great first project to implement:

- Simple well known interface: common UX.
- Basic UI components powered with CSS framework: TailwindCSS.
- Simple navigation: list page and edit page.
- CRUD operations: create, read, update, delete.
- API response handling: success and error.
- End-to-end and Component tests.
