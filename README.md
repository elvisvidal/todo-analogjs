# TODO AnalogJS (Angular)

With the evolution of the internet and its various tools, I often find myself learning much easier with a hands-on approach, gradually increasing the difficulty with chunks of functionality and complexity.

Despite the simplicity of a todo app, it is a great first project to implement:

- **Simple well-known interface**: Common UX.
- **Basic UI components** Powered with CSS framework: TailwindCSS.
- **Simple navigation**: List page and Edit page.
- **CRUD operations**: Create, read, update, delete.
- **API response handling**: Success and error.
- **ORM**: using Prisma to abstract database interactions.
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Utilizes GitHub Actions to automate the testing and deployment pipeline.
- **End-to-end and Component tests**: combining Cypress and Vitest.
